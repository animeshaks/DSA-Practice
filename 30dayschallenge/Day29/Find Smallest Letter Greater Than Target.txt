744. Find Smallest Letter Greater Than Target - https://leetcode.com/problems/find-smallest-letter-greater-than-target/

class Solution {
public:
    char nextGreatestLetter(vector<char>& letters, char target) {
        int n = letters.size();
        int start = 0;
        int end = n-1;
        int mid = (start+end)/2;
        while(start<=end){
            if(letters[mid]>target)
                end = mid-1;
            else
                start = mid+1;
            mid = (start+end)/2;
        }
        return letters[start%n];
    }
};

Note: At return statement doing modulo because if we reached at end and still not got any minimum greater than target , then according to question we have to return 1st char for eg: ['a',' b'] & target = z, then we have to return 'a' as ans. lets take one more example ['c', 'f', 'j'] & target = 'j' then output will be 'c' .
