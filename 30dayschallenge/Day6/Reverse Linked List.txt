206. Reverse Linked List - https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/

Steps :
	1. Initialize a node name prev - it will contain the current node's previous element(Reverse LL's)
	2. Loop till head != null
		a. Create a temp node that will hold next value
		b. put head's next value as prev
		c. put prev = head, as it will be previous node in Reversed LL
		d. Reassign head to head.next ie. tem node

class Solution {
    public ListNode reverseList(ListNode head) {
        ListNode prev = null;
        while(head != null){
            ListNode temp = head.next;
            head.next = prev;
            prev = head;
            head = temp;
        }
        return prev;
    }
}
